    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my website. It's a work in progress as I work my way 
      through the <strong><a href="https://launchschool.com">Launch School</a></strong> curriculum.
    </p>
    <p class="more-text">
      I've utilized CSS and the class attribute on top of the last two &lt;p&gt; tags 
    </p>
    <p class="more-text" id="final-paragraph">
      The final paragraph utilizes the 'ID' attribute as well as the "class" attribute.
      That is why the paragraph is underlined.
